      going to the gym, swimming, and paints from time to time.

    <div id = "about">
    <p>I've worked on various projects such as DNS Encryptions using Reactsjs and Express. This was done for my Networks class in order to demonstrate our knowledge about encryption. 
        In a previous internship, I created an email parser that would auto-reply to emails when certain words were sent. Furthermore, I'm also a Teaching Assistant for UTRGV!
