      <p>I'm a South Texas resident who currently happens to be a STEP intern. 
          I'm with the GCloud team that handles the infrastructure of it. 
          They help out in authintication and providing safe API calls to GCloud.
           I gathered some of my first experience from a local internship at a
            Doctor's office. In this experience, I learned about email parsing, SMTP, 
            IMAP, and python. Currently, I'm not sure what I want my focus to be on, 
            but one thing is for sure I don't want to do UI/UX</p>
