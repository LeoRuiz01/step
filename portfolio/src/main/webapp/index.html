            My name is Leonardo Ruiz, and I'm currently a rising junior 
            at the University of Rio Grande Valley. I'm a Computer Science major that loves to play video games,
            going to the gym, and swimming.

      <img src = "/images/python.png" alt = "Language that the email parser was made in" align = "right" width = "250px" height = "250px">   
      <p>I've worked on various projects such as DNS Encryption using ReactJs and Express. This was done for my Networks class in order to demonstrate our knowledge about encryption while also learning about the React framework.
        In a previous internship, I created an email parser that would auto-reply to emails when certain words were sent in by using SMTP and IMAP protocols to communicate with the servers and it used Python as the language.
