      <p>Hi guys! This is a page about me. In order to let you know about my background,
           my parents are from Reynosa,Mexico. They came to this country in order to escape the cartel violence
            that was/is going on at the moment. They abonded their previous life in order to give my 
            siblings and I a better life. </p>
